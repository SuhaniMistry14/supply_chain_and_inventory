# Supply Chain & Inventory Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end Supply Chain and Inventory Analysis solution developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into revenue performance, delivery efficiency, inventory movement, and profitability across regions and product categories to support data-driven business decisions.

##  Objectives
- Analyze overall revenue, profit, and order trends
- Evaluate delivery performance and late shipment patterns
- Identify inventory movement trends and stockout risks
- Assess the impact of discounts on profitability
- Compare regional and category-level performance

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and performance metrics  
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- **Data Visualization** – Business-focused dashboards and insights

   - Stockout risk analysis by region and category  

4. **Profitability & Discounts**  
   - Loss-making categories  
   - Discount rate vs order profitability analysis

## Key Insights
- Certain regions contribute high revenue but also experience higher late delivery rates.
- Specific product categories show consistent delivery delays, impacting customer satisfaction.
- Higher discount rates are correlated with reduced profitability for select categories.
- Inventory movement analysis highlights regions with potential stockout risks.

---

##  Assumptions & Limitations
- Inventory-on-hand data was unavailable; therefore, inventory performance is analyzed using sales movement metrics rather than traditional inventory turnover ratios.
- Delivery performance metrics are calculated using distinct order counts to avoid line-item duplication.
